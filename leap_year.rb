accept a year value from the user, check whether
it's a leap year, and then return true or false.
With the help of this leap_year?() method calculate
and display the number of minutes in a leap year
(2000 and 2004) and the number of minutes in a
non-leap year (1900 and 2005). Note: a century
year, like 1900 and 2000, is a leap year only if
it is divisible by 400.
